# This is an example docker-compose file to quickly test an IPFS Cluster
# with multiple peers on a contained environment.

# It runs 3 cluster peers (cluster0, cluster1...) attached to go-ipfs daemons
# (ipfs0, ipfs1...) using the CRDT consensus component. Cluster peers
# autodiscover themselves using mDNS on the docker internal network.
#
# To interact with the cluster use "ipfs-cluster-ctl" (the cluster0 API port is
# exposed to the locahost. You can also "docker exec -ti cluster0 sh" and run
# it from the container. "ipfs-cluster-ctl peers ls" should show all 3 peers a few
# seconds after start.
#
# For persistance, a "compose" folder is created and used to store configurations
# and states. This can be used to edit configurations in subsequent runs. It looks
# as follows:
#
# repo/
# |-- cluster
# |-- ipfs
# 
# During the first start, default configurations are created for all peers.
